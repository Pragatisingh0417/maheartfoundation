            On August 27, 2024, over 300 guests were present at the banquet hall of the Hilton Hotel in
Yaoundé to attend the official launching of The Mercy Azoh-Mbi Heart Foundation in Cameroon
The event was organized under the high patronage of the Prime Minister, head of government,
Joseph Dion Ngute who was flanked by other dignitaries, including H.E. Felix Mbayu, Minister
in Charge of the Commonwealth; Prof. Fuh Calistus Gentry, Acting Minister of Mines, Industry
and Technological Development. This ceremony was combined with a book launch of “Miracle

Foundation, people will be educated on how to take good care of their hearts so as to prevent
cardiovascular diseases.

    His Excellency Solomon Azoh-Mbi, the Board Chair of the Foundation, expressed gratitude to
all the personalities who answered present and to all those who supported the Foundation with

the foundation his wife fought to build but was taken by the cold hands of death, finally came to
pass.

her welcome remarks appreciated the efforts of all present to witness the ceremony. She said
