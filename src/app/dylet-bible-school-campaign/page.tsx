We’re thrilled to share the success of The Mercy Azoh-Mbi Heart Foundation’s recent Heart Health Sensitization and Screening Campaign at the Dylet Bible School and Church in Biyemassi-Yaoundé. On June 21, 2025, we brought vital heart health awareness and services directly to the community.

                    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Our mission was clear: to educate, detect, and empower. We provided interactive health talks on essential topics like hypertension, healthy eating, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications. Following these discussions, we offered FREE on-site screenings for blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and blood sugar levels, helping to identify individuals at risk.




                    </p>

                    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Out of 33 total participants, 25 members of the congregation were screened. The event was supported by 7 volunteers, including 3 medical doctors and 4 medical students from the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Yaoundé. They served as trainers, facilitators, and assisted with screening and general consultations.
