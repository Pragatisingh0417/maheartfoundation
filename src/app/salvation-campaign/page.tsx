            On Saturday, May 31, 2025, The Mercy Azoh-Mbi Heart Foundation conducted its monthly sensitization and screening campaign at the Salvation Baptist Church in Obili, Yaoundé. This event commemorated World Hypertension Day, with the theme “Measure your blood pressure accurately, Control it and Live Longer”.                    </p>

          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The campaign aimed to raise awareness about cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension and its complications, among the church’s men and women. It also sought to provide free screenings for hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes, and diabetic/hypertensive nephropathy , establish a link with the church for future collaboration , increase the foundation’s public visibility , and recruit volunteers.



          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Out of 33 total participants, 25 members of the congregation were screened. The event was supported by 7 volunteers, including 3 medical doctors and 4 medical students from the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Yaoundé. They served as trainers, facilitators, and assisted with screening and general consultations.
